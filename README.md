centerstage.js
==============

Centerstage.js is a simple jQuery plugin which allows you to quickly create an interactive gallery from a group of elements. It creates a 'focus on hover' effect to make your content stand out.

##Usage

To use this plugin, include the centerstage.css file in the head of your document, and the centerstage.js file in the bottom of your body tag (after jQuery).
Next, add the class '.cs-item' to all the elements you'd like to be affected. 
And finally, in your JS file, call the .centerStage() function on the CONTAINER you'd like to be affected.
